# Clipboard

Clipboard is a tool to manage and organize your clipboard. You can add notes on click everywhere, or import files you
saved previously.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change
any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Deploy

Run `ng build --base-href` to build the project. Then run `npx angular-cli-ghpages --dir=dist/clipboard`
to deploy the app to github pages.

The app will be available then [here](https://jensmeichler.github.io/clipboard/)
