# Clipboard

Clipboard is a tool to manage and organize your clipboard.
You can add notes on click everywhere, or import files you
saved previously.

## Development server

### Web app

Run `npm start` for a dev server.
Navigate to `http://localhost:4201/`.
The app will automatically reload if you change
any of the source files.

### Desktop app

Run `tauri dev` to start the desktop app with a dev server.

## Build

### Web app

Run `npm run build` to build the project.
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/clipboard/` directory.

### Desktop app

Run `tauri build` to build the installer for the OS you are currently on.

You need to have at least Rust installed onto your system ([See documentation](https://tauri.studio/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites)).
